This repository contains the project files for a data analysis and modeling task conducted for the National Organization for Counterfeit Money Prevention (ONCFM). The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit Euro banknotes based on specific dimensions and features of the bills.

Project Overview
As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with creating a reliable model that can identify counterfeit Euro banknotes using various physical attributes. The project was carried out on-site at ONCFM, under the guidance of Marie, the data analysis project manager. The analysis involved extensive data preprocessing, exploration, and the development of multiple machine learning models to find the most accurate approach.
